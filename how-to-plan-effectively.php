                    <h4>Understand the IELTS Exam Format</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Listening (30 minutes): </b><p>Four recordings with different accents and question types.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Reading (60 minutes): </b><p>Three passages with various question formats.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Writing (60 minutes): </b><p>Task 1 (describing a graph, chart, or diagram) and Task 2 (essay writing).</p></li>
                        <li><b>Speaking (11–14 minutes): </b><p>A face-to-face interview with three parts—introduction, long turn, and discussion.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Familiarizing yourself with the format helps in setting realistic goals and knowing what to expect on test day.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Assess Your Current Level</h4>
                    <p>Taking a practice test at the beginning of your preparation helps identify your strengths and weaknesses. Analyze your performance to determine which sections need improvement. If you struggle with Reading but perform well in Listening, allocate more time to reading practice in your study plan.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Set Clear Goals and Timeline</h4>
                    <p>Define your target band score and create a timeline based on your exam date. If you have three months before the test, break down your preparation into weekly targets.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Month 1:</b> Focus on understanding question types and improving fundamental skills.</li>
                        <li><b>Month 2:</b> Practice time management and develop exam strategies.</li>
                        <li><b>Month 3:</b> Take full-length mock tests and refine weak areas.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Daily Study Plan Structure</h4>
                    <p>An effective IELTS study plan should balance all four sections while giving extra time to weaker areas. A sample daily schedule could be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Listening (30–45 minutes):</b> Practice with IELTS listening tests, note key points, and improve concentration.</li>
                        <li><b>Reading (45–60 minutes):</b> Read newspapers, academic articles, and practice IELTS reading tests.</li>
                        <li><b>Writing (60 minutes):</b> Practice Task 1 and Task 2, focusing on structure, coherence, and grammar.</li>
                        <li><b>Speaking (30 minutes):</b> Practice with a partner or record yourself answering common IELTS questions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Use Quality Study Materials</h4>
                    <p>Rely on authentic IELTS preparation books and online resources. Some of the best resources include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cambridge IELTS Series (official past papers)</li>
                        <li>British Council, IDP, and IELTS websites (free practice tests)</li>
                        <li>BBC News, The Guardian, and TED Talks (for listening and reading practice)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Practice with Timed Mock Tests</h4>
                    <p>IELTS demands time management for the Reading and Writing sections. Take full-length mock tests in exam conditions to build stamina and improve speed. Analyzing mistakes after each test refines your strategies and builds confidence.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Improve Your Speaking Skills</h4>
                    <p>Speaking fluently and confidently is a crucial requirement for an excellent IELTS Speaking score. Practice speaking with a language partner, online speaking groups, or record yourself answering IELTS-style questions. Work on pronunciation, coherence, and lexical resource to upgrade your responses.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Stay Consistent and Motivated</h4>
                    <p>Consistency is the way to success in IELTS. Stick to your study plan, track your progress, and change your schedule if you have to. Maintain motivation by making small goals and rewarding yourself whenever you achieve them.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Final Week Before the Exam</h4>
                    <p>The last week is meant for revision, not learning. Go through the common mistakes you made, do some final mock tests, and practice relaxation techniques so that you can be very calm on the day of the test.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>A well-planned IELTS study schedule ensures steady progress and effective preparation. With an understanding of the exam format, clear goals, quality resources, and regular practice, you will be able to confidently achieve your target band score. Stay disciplined, stay motivated, and trust the process—success in IELTS is within your reach.</p>
